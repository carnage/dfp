Remove iterator from format abstract. Instead rely on the facade to provide iteration. (Much cleaner)
Instead the format will simply load the next record/reset feed to begining on demand.

This means that the facade can take a bigger role in the processing of the feed and makes formats easier
to implement. 

The facade should also now pull errors from the format and add them to itself.

Once this is done, some methods need to be added to the facade to facilitate adding filters and validators
on a per field basis. Whenever the facade goes to the format object to get a record it should filter and
validate the record it gets back. Obviously a none valid record would result in an error being recorded
and the next record being fetched instead.
